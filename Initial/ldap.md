# LDAP (Port 389)

While Kerberos is the authentication protocol of Active Directory, LDAP is the protocol that provides the means to query information in the directory. We can attempt to extract information from the site with python

```python
python3 -i
>>> import ldap3
>>> server = ldap3.Server('$ip', get_info = ldap3.ALL, port = 389, use_ssl = True)
>>> connection = ldap3.Connection(server)
>>> connection.bind()
```

If connection is reset by the peer, this means we cannot extract information without credentials. We can also run an nmap enumeration script

```bash
nmap -n --script=ldap* $ip
```

Ldap service enum:

```bash
ldapsearch -h $ip -p 389 -x -s base
```
